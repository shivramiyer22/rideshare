## 🎯 BUSINESS OBJECTIVES

### Primary Goals

## 🎯 Business Rules

The Data Ingestion Agent needs to run to:
1. Create MongoDB collection called pricing_strategies or use existing if it already exists. This collection should be able to accommodate multiple strategy types such as business-objectives, dynamic-pricing-rules, surge-rules, competitive-rules, customer-retention-rules, event-driven-pricing-rules etc.
2. Create API end point to allow manual upload of pricing_strategies collection for 1 or more data types
3. Add and implement below routing in data_ingestion.py 

   routing_map = {
       ...
       "pricing_strategies": "strategy_knowledge_vectors",
       "business_rules": "strategy_knowledge_vectors"
   }

4. Populate the pricing_strategies with below below list under a strategy type of business-objectives

a. **Maximize Revenue:** Increase 15-25% through intelligent pricing
b. **Maximize Profit Margins:** Optimize without losing customers
c. **Stay Competitive:** Real-time competitor analysis
d. **Customer Retention:** Reduce churn 10-15%
e. **Data-Driven Decisions:** AI-powered insights

5. Add and implement capability for Data Ingestion Agent to Read documents from MongoDB pricing_strategies collection
2. Generate text descriptions
3. Create OpenAI embeddings
4. Store in ChromaDB strategy_knowledge_vectors
